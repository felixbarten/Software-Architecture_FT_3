# Logbook Software Architecture

# Date: 2 September 2015 Time: 14:00- 16:30

## Had a discussion about the logbooks.

We've decided to pick the Markdown format for composing the report. Markdown is easy to learn and supports conversions to PDF files (which was a requirement). 
We didn't choose LaTeX or word because not everyone in the team was familiar with LaTeX and word/openoffice wasn't as convenient as markdown where just a simple text editor is required.


## Had a discussion about the storage method of the logs and report.

We have decided to store the logs and report on a Git repository on github.


## Discussed Stakeholders

In order to derive a list of stakeholders we've discussed this topic at length to get to the bottom of our projects' stakeholders. At first it was proposed to use the entirety of the company as one massive stakeholder but after some discussion this idea was rejected in favor of specifying the various groups within the company.
Doing the grouping listed above would have lost a lot of depth because requirements would be hard to trace back to their shareholders. Specifying more thoroughly which groups within the company have a stake in the project makes it possible to gain more insight in the various roles of the company's personnel. 

Because the application of the robot will likely be in medical/consumer environments I suggested it would be a good idea to certify the device for being safe for the public. In order to make sure our product will comply with regulations we added the NZa to the list of stakeholders.

### Are they going to sell directly to the end customer or sell to wholesalers to let them take the distributing on themselves?

We decided to sell the product to the wholesalers because it's easier to move than to set up an own retail channel or distribute the product online. 

### Are the postal services a stakeholder? If the product is sold via a reseller?

We decided to exclude the postal services from being a stakeholder. because it's not our concern if the product should be able to be moved via post as long as we deliver it to the wholesaler. 

### Had a small discussion whether researchers should be a different group of stakeholders than developers.	

Decided to include researchers as a different group of stakeholders because their tasks differ from a developer significantly. 

### We debated whether to include health insurance companies as stakeholders in the project

We've decided to include the health insurance companies as possible stakeholders in our project. The health insurance stakeholders were included because of the medical applications for our product in elderly homes and or hospitals. There might be reason to consider a special healthcare specific version of the product later but it's too early to speculate on that possibility. 


## Discussed functionalities 

We have discussed a number of possible functionalities that are all semi "possible" (see questions). Because the project is intended to be used for both medical applications and general environments a more general feature set is chosen instead of focussing on the medical aspect of the product. It may be better to make a specific product line for that type of robots down the line if the initial product is a success. 

We've chosen a few basic features to start the project off. 

* Must be able to call for assistance in case of an emergency If medical emergency is detected by the robot it should contact emergency services

* Must be able to help people to get back up in the case of falling down In case the resident falls down and cannot get up then it should aid them by helping them stand back up

* Must be able to remind users of (important) subjects/appointments
Customers must be able to instruct the robot to remind them about an appointment/subject

* Must be able to respond to a doorbell (open door, greet, serve coffee or tea) The resident/customer may not be physically able to respond to the door bell

* Must be able to prepare meals The resident may not be able to cook for him/herself

* Must be able to help with coffee It can also make coffee because the customer needs to drink something after the meal

* Must be able to play movies/music or read stories The customer may not receive visitors often so it should be able to entertain them

## Questions that came up during our sessions

* Should the requirements be "realistic"? In the exercise it's listed the robot should be socially engaging for people who are lonely. This can be interpreted a number of ways but for example conversations with said robot would not be a very realistic proposition because the technology is not there yet. So should all the requirements be "theoretically possible" or is it open for any interpretation as this case will not be built.

## Discussion with Rene about our stakeholders from 2 september

We asked Rene about our main question from 2 september. All functionalities should be tailored for the desired group of end users. 

- Our stakeholders are numerous but some stakeholders were not listed which should have been included in our list of stakeholders
- We decided to make our end user more specific: Our end users should be people who are able to take care of themselves but have limitations. Such as not very mobile etc..
- Our proposed functionalities were basic and not tailored towards the target audience and should be revised 
- Our functionalities should be focussed more on the robot possibilities and less "smartphone" features.
