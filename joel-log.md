Log book : 09/09/2015
======================

- Revised Stakeholders and merged work with that of our new Team member.

- Q: Maybe insurance companies can act as customers?  

For the next lecture :

Create a presentation?

Double check stakeholders and Future stakeholders

Focus more on stakeholders 

Focus more on architecture (Report & Questions)

The report does not have to be complete 

Consider an end of lifecycle service for removal

Take one stakeholder and work them out to avoid an high level overview. Workout one specific point in the presentation

Prioritize stakeholders based on the gravitiy their interests and concerns affect the architecture

Define interface for interacting with other systems

*Personal Note: I am bad at working with vague requirements it affects my motivation*
