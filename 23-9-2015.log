Make it easy to use the code

"Page 3 Stakeholders:" There's a lot fluff in the document (Things are duplicated and mentioned multiple times for the same stakeholders.

Be more specific about interacting with the robot.

Why replacement of nurse (Like to safe money)? Reason about the actual problems and not solutions.

The purpose is discussion.

There should be a rational for every decision taken (Reasoning).

The *context question* is okay don't worry too much.

The logical view is too technical and abstract. It should mean/ say something for the intended audience. (Logical view = end-user/less-technical stakeholders)

Use a usecase to verify the work (4+1 implementation).

Processing is unclear. Fault tolerance (What is it and how should you do?) One component probably can't do.

It is timeboxed. Document the discussion. Don't dwell too much on one topic. It does not need to be complete.

The point about this week is the ability to reflect on it.
